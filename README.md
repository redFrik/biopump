# biopump

A piece for 3DMIN's PushPull instrument

## Background

This interactive audiovisual composition was commissioned by [3DMIN](http://3dmin.org) and supported by the festival/conference [GLOBALE: Performing Sound, Playing Technology](http://zkm.de/event/2016/02/globale-performing-sound-playing-technology). It was premiered 2016-02-05 in Karlsruhe at the ZKM Kubus.

This is a piece for the [PushPull](http://www.3dmin.org/research/open-development-and-design/pushpull/) instrument and works a bit like a game where the performer(s) need to pump up the sound - and keep on pumping for the piece to develop. If played by a single person the performer has to select which sounds to keep breeding. All sounds and graphics are generated in realtime.
